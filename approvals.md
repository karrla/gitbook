#####Tola Activity Forms with Approvals:**  
Sites, Stakeholders, Indicators, Project Agreements & Project Completions

**Approvers: **
Anyone can approve Sites, Stakeholders, and Indicators. (Sites are usually reviewed and managed by field managers or community mobilizers, Stakeholders by program officers, and Indicators by M&E managers ). Project Agreements and Completions can only be approved by users in the Approvers group. 

**Approvers Group:**
To assign someone as an Approver in Tola Activity, they need to be added to the Approvers group in the Admin Console. 

**Approval Notifications:**
When a Project Agreements or Project Completion is set to “Awaiting Approval” the email notification goes out to all Approvers in the country letting them know the Project Agreement or Completion is ready to be approved. Approval email notifications are not (currently) limited by fund codes or Programs.

**Limiting Tola Activity Approvals:**
Teams can limit approvals in Tola Activity on Project Agreement and Completions by turning on “Tola Approval Authority budget limits” for certain programs and assigning specific budget limits to specific Approvers in the Admin Console. See screencast

**Tola Approval Authority:**
The budget limit set for each approver is decided separately by each country team depending on the complexity of their programs. Tola approval matrix is not the same as the Approval Authority Matrix (AAM) used by Finance.

**Project Agreement Approvals:**
Once a Project Agreement is approved a Project Completion form will be created, and the Project Agreement will be set to read-only once that Project Completion is saved.
