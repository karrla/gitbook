###Workflow Form Name Changes: Project Initiations and Project Tracking
We upgraded the name of our two main workflow forms to better define their use in workflow. 

**Project Initiation**
Initiates the start of a project and describes the justification, start, and end date, estimated budget, and approvals for any project.  This documents the <b>WHAT </b> and links to the site and stakeholder profiles.<br> 
**Project Tracking**
Tracks and documents what actually happened (dates, budget, results) in a project compared to what was estimated in the Initiation Form. Additionally, it also documents the impact of the project and any lessons learned or issues/challenges.
