### **Stakeholder profile**



Documents primary stakeholders we work with (partners, communities, businesses/entities, etc.) and information about them. This documents the WHO.

### Project Initiation and Tracking Forms


Initiates the start of a project and describes the justification, start, and end date, estimated budget, and approvals for any project.  This documents the WHAT and links to the site and stakeholder profiles. 


Created after the initiation of a project and documents what actually happens (dates, budget, results) compared to what was estimated in the initiation form. Additionally, it also documents the impact of the project and any lessons learned or issues/challenges.
