### **Site Profile**



Documents basic information about a geographic location we work in, the GPS coordinates of that location, and basic demographic information if relevant. This documents the WHERE. 


### **Stakeholder profile**



Documents primary stakeholders we work with (partners, communities, businesses/entities, etc.) and information about them. This documents the WHO.

### Project agreement


Initiates the start of a project and describes the justification, start, and end date, estimated budget, and approvals for any project.  This documents the WHAT and links to the site and stakeholder profiles. 


### **Project Completion**



Completed after the end of a project and documents what actually happened (dates, budget, results) compared to what was estimated in the agreement form. Additionally, it also documents the impact of the project and any lessons learned or issues/challenges.
