We **welcome and encourage** your feedback and requests! And we have a few tools to help us support you!

First we are on [Slack](https://tola-users.slack.com/messages/general/)! Join the discussions! Ask questions, get feedback, find answers...

And we have a work queue [TOLA.WORK](http://tola.work)! Where we would love you to provide feedback on issues and input on new ideas. You can even vote on your favorite new enhancements! We encourage it. It helps us prioritize the features our users what you want!

[Search](http://tola.work/helpdesk/tickets/)
 and [Vote!](http://tola.work/helpdesk/tickets/)
 
Each ticket has a vote/thumbs up or down button. Please vote for enhancements you think are important. Each vote for a ticket will bring the issue higher in the Tola work queue.
Best practices entering a ticket: When entering a problem or bug ticket, please add the following:  

<i>What browser are you using?

<i>What, if any, error message did you get?

<i>What did you expect to happen?

<i>What did happened? 

###Entering a [Tola.Work](http://tola.work) quality ticket

**Lack of Information in a Request: **

" I found an error when I was working in Tola Activity."

<i>We want to get to fixing the issue, but it's hard to know where to start troubleshooting without more information

**Quality Detailed Request: **

"When clicking the submit button under Project (ID Number) > Program Initiation (Name)  > Executive Summary, I get an error. 
<br><br>
I have pasted in the following error and the page URL where I found the error."

<i> Now that is more like it! We can immediately start looking into the issue! Thanks!
