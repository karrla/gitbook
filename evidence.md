# Evidence



Each time you enter newly collected data for your Program Indicators in Tola Activity, you will want to link evidence to that data. Evidence can be in many formats.

##Four Types of Evidence

###Type 1: Mobile Data + Table Evidence (tabular)
Data collected through data collection service providers, such as Ona, KoboToolbox, FormHub or other service that can be  other imported into TolaTables and then linked to your indicators in TolaActivity. 

###Type 2: Spreadsheet + Tables (tabular)
Other data in spreadsheet format can be imported into TolaTables and then linked to your indicators in TolaActivity. 

###Type 3:Document link (non-tabular)

All other evidence documents will be entered into Tola Activity directly in the Document section of Tola Activity.  When entering your document, you will want to associate it with your indicator's Program so later it will be available in the Evidence section of the Indicator Data Form in Tola Activity.  

###Type 4: No Evidence :(
