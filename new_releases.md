<p style="font-size:20px"> <b> Workflow Form Name Changes: 

<b> Project Initiations and Project Tracking Forms






Agreements and Completions changed to:
**Project Initiations and Project Tracking**

We upgraded the name of our two main workflow forms to better define their use in workflow. 

**Project Initiation**

Initiates the start of a project and describes the justification, start, and end date, estimated budget, and approvals for any project.  This documents the WHAT and links to the site and stakeholder profiles. 

**Project Tracking**
Tracks and documents what actually happened (dates, budget, results) in a project compared to what was estimated in the Initiation Form. Additionally, it also documents the impact of the project and any lessons learned or issues/challenges.
